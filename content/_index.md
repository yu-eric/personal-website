## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

I am a former software engineer at [Creative Juice](https://www.getjuice.com/). I graduated from the University of Utah in 2022 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.

## Research

I worked with [Dr. Chris Myers](https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/chris-myers) at the [Genetic Logic Lab](http://geneticlogiclab.org/) for four years during my undergraduate studies. My focuses included large scale genetic data repositories and search methods for genetic sequences.
