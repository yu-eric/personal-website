## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

I am a graduate student currently enrolled at the University College of London (UCL) for a Masters of Science in Software Systems Engineering. My current courses include Software Validation & Verification, Engineering Ethics, and Data Engineering / MLOps Pipelines.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Creative Juice](https://www.linkedin.com/company/getcreativejuice/). 

## Education and Research

I graduated from the University of Utah in 2022 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I worked with [Dr. Chris Myers](https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/chris-myers) at the [Genetic Logic Lab](http://geneticlogiclab.org/) during my undergraduate studies. My focuses included large scale genetic data repositories and search methods for genetic sequences.
