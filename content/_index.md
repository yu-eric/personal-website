## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

I am a recent graduate of University College London (UCL) with a Master's of Science in Software Systems Engineering. This summer, I interned as a Software Engineer at Cisco London, building an open-source cross-platform [video player](https://github.com/LumaFoundry/YUViz) and inspection tool.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Creative Juice](https://www.linkedin.com/company/getcreativejuice/), a Series A, Forbes 50 Fintech startup. 

## Education and Research

I graduated from the University of Utah in 2022 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I worked with [Dr. Chris Myers](https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/chris-myers) at the [Genetic Logic Lab](http://geneticlogiclab.org/) from 2019-2022. My focuses included large scale genetic data repositories and search methods for genetic sequences, utilizing tools such as Elasticsearch and RDF / document databases.

## Hobbies
You can probably find me somewhere outdoors, whether I'm backpacking, rock climbing, fishing, mountain biking, or [skiing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9IFwDykJag). I'm also a huge sports fan, watching everything from soccer (COYS) to sumo wresting, or basketball to bowling (my current obsession is darts).
